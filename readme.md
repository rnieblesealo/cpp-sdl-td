### Notes
Sprite postiions are relative to their center; everything else's position isn't

### Idea 
Tower defense game, but you control the invaders instead!

- You can spawn in tanks of different colors, from a budget given at the beginning of the level
- The game spawns towers in as well from a budget too; it'll also tell you what tower it's spawning next, when, and where
- You can select an individual tank and tell it to hit a specific tower 
    - Click on the tank, then on the tower 
- You can also command each overall color to target a specific structure
    - Double-click on one tank of the desired color, then click on the tower
- If a tank destroyed its structure, it'll auto-target the closest tower
- **You win when enough tanks have reached the end, or when the game is out of towers!**
- There will be power-ups which can be applied to tanks, giving them extra damage, resistance, etc.


### Maps
1. Make maps by hand in image editor using tile editor
2. Hard-code paths by hand

This is the least confusing + most painless way to do things!
